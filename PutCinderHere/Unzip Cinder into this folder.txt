Download Cinder for VS2012 here:
http://libcinder.org/releases/cinder_0.8.5_vc2012.zip

Then unzip it into this directory. 

Alternately, you can move the cinder folder (cinder_0.8.5_vc2012)
into the folder that holds this program, in case you're downloading
a bunch of the Laboratory Cinder code, so you don't have multiple
copies running around everywhere. So, you'd have a directory

LaboratoryArt (or something)

that would have these directories

LaboratoryArt/004-deltaT/
LaboratoryArt/cinder_0.8.5_vc2012/

and that should compile nicely as well.
Remember, you'll need Visual Studio 2012 (NOT 2013!!!) to get
these to compile
